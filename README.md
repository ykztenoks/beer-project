## BeeryGood.

This is our second project , developed in the 6th week of the Ironhack Web Development bootcamp gathering all the knowledge we've got from ReactJS.

It's a group project meant to train CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and test different libraries.

We've developed a webpage for beer lovers, where you can check out some beers from around the world, get suggestions on how to fully enjoy the drinking experience, food-pairings and even add a beer to the database, so others can try your favorite beer!
